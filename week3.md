| Basic Search          | Implemented `/search` endpoint     | Added a unified search endpoint to search guides and posts by title and description.        | [https://github.com/bishnulimbu/6thsemProjectLinuxGuide/commit/a27444911dd17ddb0e4f4c154b0765ffc26dc3d2] |

**Completed on Time?**  
Yes

**Challenges Faced:**

- Styling with Tailwind CSS required learning its utility-first approach.
- Sequelize `Op.or` queries for search were initially returning incorrect results due to improper syntax.

**What I Learned:**

- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
- Advanced Sequelize querying with operators like `Op.or` and `Op.like`.
