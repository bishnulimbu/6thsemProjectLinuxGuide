**Completed on Time?**  
Yes

**Challenges Faced:**

- Filtering logic in the backend to exclude tag matches for guides while keeping them for posts was tricky.
- Ensuring the UI displayed tags correctly required handling cases where tags might be empty.

**What I Learned:**

- Advanced filtering logic with Sequelize and JavaScript array methods.
- Conditional rendering in React for optional data (e.g., tags).
